    name: Samson '<i>Silverbeard</i>' Huurt
    race: Human
    occupation: Bodyguard
    backstory: >
        The first thing Samson remembers is sitting bolt upright, IVs and clamps ripping from his skin. Doctors and nurses chattering
        at him in chinese trying to force him down back onto the bed, one approached him with a syringe, his instincts kicked in and his adrenal 
        glands swelled and he propelled himself with inhuman stength from the tabls, tearing off the constrains as if they were paper.
        
        Taking off down an alley, which despite being well into the night, he could see clearly, his legs pumping with almost pnumatic frequency, he began to succumb to the blood loss from the open wounds and unfinished work
        on his body, and collapsed into a pile of garbage.
        
        His almost dead body was found by a Dr Cheng, a street doc, who makes a living patching up street thugs and runners. Cheng put him back together, and
        as payment Samson would run security for the Docs shop, intimidating those who couldnt pay, or undoing the fix up work for those
        who tried to dodge a payment.

      Duration: 3 (1/round)
<<<<<<< HEAD
      Trappings: >
        A mystical glow, hardened skin, ethereal armor,
        a mass of insects or worms.
        Armor creates a field of magical protection around a
        character or an actual shell of some sort, effectively giving the
        target Armor. Success grants the recipient 2 points of Armor.
        A raise grants 4 points of Armor.
        Whether the armor is visible or not depends largely on the
        trapping.
=======
      Effect: Subdermal armor becomes denser. Success grants the recipient 2 points of Armor.
              A raise grants 4 points of Armor.

    - name: Boost/Lower Trait
      Rank: Novice
      Power Points: 2
      Range: Smarts
      Duration: 3 (1/round)
<<<<<<< HEAD
      Trappings: >
        Physical change, glowing aura, potions.
        This power allows a character to increase any of a target’s
        Traits by one die type for a standard success, or by two with a
        raise. The affected Trait can exceed d12. Each step over d12
        adds +1 to his Trait total. For example, a raise on someone
        who already has a d12 in the affected Trait grants him d12+2
        for the duration of the power.
        The power can also be used to lower an opponent’s Trait.
        This is an opposed roll against the victim’s Spirit. Success
        lowers any Trait of the caster’s choice one step, a raise lowers
        it two steps. A Trait cannot be lowered below a d4. Multiple
        castings stack, though the caster must keep track of when
        each casting expires as usual.
